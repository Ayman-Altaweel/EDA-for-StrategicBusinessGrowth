  # **Modeling**

  - We've built **[[ML Algo]]** to predict **[[target]]** using **[[Inputs]]**.

  | HyperParameters | Values   |
  |-----------------|----------|
  |                 |          |
  |                 |          |

  - Our model's accuracy is **[[## %]]** (i.e For every 100 predictions, there are ## predictions are true.)
